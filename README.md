## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
variables/coefficients with a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle_length and ground_clearance.
No, it's not zero. The Intercept is a negative -1.040e+02 
Yes, this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. Multiple R-squared:  0.7149 which means that roughly 71% of the mpg will be correct if we use the model.Also, the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller 0.05 significance level.
